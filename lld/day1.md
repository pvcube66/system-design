what the fuck is lld?
when we build an entire application using the concepts of
dsa is called as lld(wtf does this even mean)

eg:
ola platform:
approach 1: take user from source to destination(shortest path algos use cheddam consider entire city as a graph(dijikstra) 999+iq).
2.assign the riders to the users based on the shortest location from the user. (use priority queue, pop u get the closest driver)

why this isnt a good approach:
niga this is just a algo not entire application
what about the relationships bw diff components
scalability
security
objects 

approach 2:
1.find all the objects/entities/components: users, riders, locations
2.relations: find the relation bw the diff components
3.data security: 
4.scalability
more like kind of build the entire system before the coding part

what lld focuses on?
1. scalability: how our system can handle millions of users
2. manitainability: how good is our code, if we add any new feature how much time its gonna take and if it doesnt break any existing shit, it should take the minimum effort to add any new feature.
easy to debug
3. reusability: the code shud be reusuable brotha (DRY-dont fuckin repeat yoself)
the code should be tightly coupled: means
the code we write should be generic as much as possible means it shud be like we can just copy paste and use it anywhere and the code shouldnt be very very specific to project

 
hld: it focuses on tech stack, dbs, scalability, cost optimizations
